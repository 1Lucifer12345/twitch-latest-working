**Credits**
- Main idea: https://github.com/gottagofaster236/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner
- ~~Bet system (Selenium): https://github.com/ClementRoyer/TwitchAutoCollect-AutoBet~~
- Based on: https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2

> A simple script that will watch a stream for you and earn the channel points.

> It can wait for a streamer to go live (+_450 points_ when the stream starts), it will automatically click the bonus button (_+50 points_), and it will follow raids (_+250 points_).

Read more about channels point [here](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/channel-points-guide).

)
```
You can also use all the default values except for your username obv. Short version:
```python
from TwitchChannelPointsMiner import TwitchChannelPointsMiner
from TwitchChannelPointsMiner.classes.Settings import FollowersOrder
twitch_miner = TwitchChannelPointsMiner("your-twitch-username")
twitch_miner.mine(["streamer1", "streamer2"])                                                       # Array of streamers OR
twitch_miner.mine(followers=True, followers_order=FollowersOrder.ASC)                               # Automatic use the followers list OR
twitch_miner.mine(["streamer1", "streamer2"], followers=True, followers_order=FollowersOrder.DESC)  # Mixed
```
If you follow so many streamers on Twitch, but you don't want to mine points for all of them, you can blacklist the users with the `blacklist` keyword. [#94](https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/issues/94)
```python
from TwitchChannelPointsMiner import TwitchChannelPointsMiner
twitch_miner = TwitchChannelPointsMiner("your-twitch-username")
twitch_miner.mine(followers=True, blacklist=["user1", "user2"])  # Blacklist example
```

### By cloning the repository
1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/rdavydov/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2`
2. Install all the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt` . If you have problems with requirements, make sure to have at least Python3.6. You could also try to create a _virtualenv_ and then install all the requirements
```sh
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start mining! `python run.py` 🥳

### Docker

#### Docker Hub
Official Docker images are on https://hub.docker.com/r/rdavidoff/twitch-channel-points-miner-v2 for `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64` and `linux/arm/v7`.

The following file is mounted :

- run.py : this is your starter script with your configuration

These folders are mounted :

- analytics : to save the analytics data
- cookies : to provide login information
- logs : to keep logs outside of container

**Example using docker-compose:**

```yml
version: "3.9"

services:
  miner:
    image: rdavidoff/twitch-channel-points-miner-v2
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    environment:
      - TERM=xterm-256color
    volumes:
      - ./analytics:/usr/src/app/analytics
      - ./cookies:/usr/src/app/cookies
      - ./logs:/usr/src/app/logs
      - ./run.py:/usr/src/app/run.py:ro
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```

**Example with docker run:**
```sh
docker run \
    -v $(pwd)/analytics:/usr/src/app/analytics \
    -v $(pwd)/cookies:/usr/src/app/cookies \
    -v $(pwd)/logs:/usr/src/app/logs \
    -v $(pwd)/run.py:/usr/src/app/run.py:ro \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    rdavidoff/twitch-channel-points-miner-v2
```

`$(pwd)` Could not work on Windows (cmd), please use the absolute path instead, like: `/path/of/your/cookies:/usr/src/app/cookies`.

The correct solution for Windows lies in the correct command line: `docker run -v C:\Absolute\Path\To\Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2\run.py:/usr/src/app/run.py:ro rdavidoff/twitch-channel-points-miner-v2`.

`run.py` MUST be mounted as a volume (`-v`).

If you don't mount the volume for the analytics (or cookies or logs) folder, the folder will be automatically created on the Docker container, and you will lose all the data when it is stopped.

If you don't have a cookie or it's your first time running the script, you will need to login to Twitch and start the container with `-it` args. If you need to run multiple containers you can bind different ports (only if you need also the analytics) and mount dirrent run.py file, like

```sh
docker run --name user1 -v $(pwd)/user1.py:/usr/src/app/run.py:ro -p 5001:5000 rdavidoff/twitch-channel-points-miner-v2
```

```sh
docker run --name user2 -v $(pwd)/user2.py:/usr/src/app/run.py:ro -p 5002:5000 rdavidoff/twitch-channel-points-miner-v2
```

[Link](https://github.com/rdavydov/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/wiki/Deploy-Docker-container-in-Portainer) to the illustrated guide on how to deploy a Docker container in Portainer.

### Replit

Official Repl with description and added keep-alive functionality: https://replit.com/@rdavydov/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2

#### Tricks to run 24/7 on Replit for free

1. Enable Analytics (set `host="0.0.0.0"`)
2. Note down the output URL (in most cases it is `https://Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2.<YOUR_REPLIT_USERNAME>.repl.co`)
3. Send an HTTP request to that URL every 5 minutes

Use a service that can send HTTP requests at regular intervals, such as Uptimerobot.

### Limits
_**Twitch has a limit - you can't watch more than two channels at one time. We take the first two streamers from the list as they have the highest priority.**_

Make sure to write the streamers array in order of priority from left to right. If you use `followers=True` you can choose to download the followers sorted by follow date (ASC or DESC).

## Settings
Most of the settings are self-explained and are commented on in the example.
You can watch only two streamers per time. With `priority` settings, you can select which streamers watch by use priority. You can use an array of priority or single item. I suggest using at least one priority from `ORDER`, `POINTS_ASCENDING`, `POINTS_DESCEDING` because, for example, If you set only `STREAK` after catch all watch streak, the script will stop to watch streamers.
Available values are the following:
 - `STREAK` - Catch the watch streak from all streamers
 - `DROPS` - Claim all drops from streamers with drops tags enabled
 - `SUBSCRIBED` - Prioritize streamers you're subscribed to (higher subscription tiers are mined first)
 - `ORDER` - Following the order of the list
 - `POINTS_ASCENDING` - On top the streamers with the lowest points
 - `POINTS_DESCEDING` - On top the streamers with the highest points

You can combine all priority but keep in mind that use `ORDER` and `POINTS_ASCENDING` in the same settings doesn't make sense.

#### Color Palette
Now you can customize the color of the terminal message. We have created a default ColorPalette that provide all the message with `DEFAULT (RESET)` color and the `BET_WIN` and `BET_LOSE` message `GREEN` and `RED` respectively. You can change the colors of all `Events` enum class. The colors allowed are all the Fore color from Colorama: `BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, RESET.`
The script was developed to handle all the human error, lower-case upper case and more, but I want to suggest using the following code-style
```python
from colorama import Fore
ColorPalette(
    STREAMER_ONLINE = Fore.GREEN,
    STREAMER_OFFLINE = Fore.RED,
    GAIN_FOR_RAID = Fore.YELLOW,
    GAIN_FOR_CLAIM = Fore.YELLOW,
    GAIN_FOR_WATCH = Fore.YELLOW,
    GAIN_FOR_WATCH_STREAK = Fore.YELLOW,
    BET_WIN = Fore.GREEN,
    BET_LOSE = Fore.RED,
    BET_REFUND = Fore.RESET,
    BET_FILTERS = Fore.MAGENTA,
    BET_GENERAL = Fore.BLUE,
    BET_FAILED = Fore.RED,
)
```

#### Bet strategy

- **MOST_VOTED**: Select the option most voted based on users count
- **HIGH_ODDS**: Select the option with the highest odds
- **PERCENTAGE**: Select the option with the highest percentage based on odds (It's the same that show Twitch) - Should be the same as select LOWEST_ODDS
- **SMART_MONEY**: Select the option with the highest points placed. [#331](https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/issues/331)
- **SMART**: If the majority in percent chose an option, then follow the other users, otherwise select the option with the highest odds

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/master/assets/prediction.png)

Here a concrete example:

- **MOST_VOTED**: 21 Users have select **'over 7.5'**, instead of 9 'under 7.5'
- **HIGH_ODDS**: The highest odd is 2.27 on **'over 7.5'** vs 1.79 on 'under 7.5'
- **PERCENTAGE**: The highest percentage is 56% for **'under 7.5'**
- **SMART**: Calculate the percentage based on the users. The percentages are: 'over 7.5': 70% and 'under 7.5': 30%. If the difference between the two percentages is higher than `percentage_gap` select the highest percentage, else the highest odds.

In this case if percentage_gap = 20 ; 70-30 = 40 > percentage_gap, so the bot will select 'over 7.5'
### FilterCondition
| Key         	| Type        	| Default 	| Description                                                                      	|
|-------------	|-------------	|---------	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `by`       	| OutcomeKeys 	| None    	| Key to apply the filter                                                          	|
| `where`      	| Condition   	| None    	| Condition that should match for place bet                                        	|
| `value`     	| number      	| None    	| Value to compare                                                                 	|

Allowed values for `by` are:
- `PERCENTAGE_USERS` (no sum) [Would never want a sum as it'd always be 100%]
- `ODDS_PERCENTAGE` (no sum) [Doesn't make sense to sum odds]
- `ODDS` (no sum) [Doesn't make sense to sum odds]
- `DECISION_USERS` (no sum)
- `DECISION_POINTS` (no sum)
- `TOP_POINTS` (no sum) [Doesn't make sense to the top points of both sides]
- `TOTAL_USERS` (sum)
- `TOTAL_POINTS` (sum)

Allowed values for `where` are: `GT, LT, GTE, LTE`

#### Example
- If you want to place the bet ONLY if the total of users participants in the bet is greater than 200
`FilterCondition(by=OutcomeKeys.TOTAL_USERS, where=Condition.GT, value=200)`
- If you want to place the bet ONLY if the winning odd of your decision is greater than or equal to 1.3
`FilterCondition(by=OutcomeKeys.ODDS, where=Condition.GTE, value=1.3)`
- If you want to place the bet ONLY if the highest bet is lower than 2000
`FilterCondition(by=OutcomeKeys.TOP_POINTS, where=Condition.LT, value=2000)`

### DelayMode

- **FROM_START**: Will wait `delay` seconds from when the bet was opened
- **FROM_END**: Will until there is `delay` seconds left to place the bet
- **PERCENTAGE**: Will place the bet when `delay` percent of the set timer is elapsed

Here's a concrete example. Let's suppose we have a bet that is opened with a timer of 10 minutes:

- **FROM_START** with `delay=20`: The bet will be placed 20s after the bet is opened
- **FROM_END** with `delay=20`: The bet will be placed 20s before the end of the bet (so 9mins 40s after the bet is opened)
- **PERCENTAGE** with `delay=0.2`: The bet will be placed when the timer went down by 20% (so 2mins after the bet is opened)

## Analytics
We have recently introduced a little frontend where you can show with a chart you points trend. The script will spawn a Flask web-server on your machine where you can select binding address and port.
The chart provides some annotation to handle the prediction and watch strike events. Usually annotation are used to notice big increase / decrease of points. If you want to can disable annotations.
On each (x, y) points Its present a tooltip that show points, date time and reason of points gained / lost. This web page was just a funny idea, and it is not intended to use for a professional usage.
If you want you can toggle the dark theme with the dedicated checkbox.

| Light theme | Dark theme |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| ![Light theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/master/assets/chart-analytics-light.png) | ![Dark theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/master/assets/chart-analytics-dark.png) |

For use this feature just call the `analytics()` method before start mining. Read more at: [#96](https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2/issues/96)
The chart will be autofreshed each `refresh` minutes. If you want to connect from one to second machine that have that webpanel you have to use `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`. With the `days_ago` arg you can select how many days you want to show by default in your analytics graph.
```python
from TwitchChannelPointsMiner import TwitchChannelPointsMiner
twitch_miner = TwitchChannelPointsMiner("your-twitch-username")
twitch_miner.analytics(host="127.0.0.1", port=5000, refresh=5, days_ago=7)   # Analytics web-server
twitch_miner.mine(followers=True, blacklist=["user1", "user2"])
```

### `enable_analytics` option in `twitch_minerfile` toggles Analytics needed for the `analytics()` method

Disabling Analytics significantly reduces memory consumption and saves some disk space by not creating and writing `/analytics/*.json`.

Set this option to `True` if you need Analytics. Otherwise set this option to `False` (default value).

## Migrating from an old repository (the original one):
If you already have a `twitch-cookies.pkl` and you don't want to log in again, please create a `cookies/` folder in the current directory and then copy the .pkl file with a new name `your-twitch-username.pkl`
```
.
+-- run.py
+-- cookies
|   +-- your-twitch-username.pkl
```

## Windows
Other users have find multiple problems on Windows. Suggestions are:
 - Stop using Windows :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 - Suppress the emoji in logs with `logger_settings=LoggerSettings(emoji=False)`
